I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Florida (Go Gators! 🐊) with a passion for building scalable backend systems and diving deep into machine learning. My goal is to tackle complex challenges in distributed systems and contribute to products that people use every day.

You might notice that my public commit history is a bit sparse. That's because the majority of my work—from internships at companies like **Intradiem** to my research and development roles at the **University of Florida**—lives on private repositories (Gerrit, Bitbucket, and private GitHub orgs). This profile is my way of sharing what I've been building!

### 🚀 What I'm Focused On

My experience centers around a few key areas. I love working across the stack, but I'm most excited by backend and infrastructure challenges.

<details>
<summary><strong>☁️ Backend & Cloud Engineering</strong></summary>
<br>
I have hands-on experience designing, building, and deploying resilient services. I'm comfortable in the entire development lifecycle, from API design to container orchestration.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Intradiem:</strong> Developed a scalable event-tracking service with Java Spring Boot and ActiveMQ to handle over 7,000 daily events. I also helped migrate legacy backend services to Kubernetes, which slashed rollback times from hours to minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>UF College of Medicine:</strong> Slashed API latency from 3 seconds to under 450ms by optimizing Oracle SQL queries and adding a Redis caching layer for a Node.js (Fastify) backend.</li>
  <li><strong>Vetra:</strong> Architected and implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and AWS (Step Functions, ECS, Docker), which cut our deployment time by over 80%.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🤖 Machine Learning & MLOps</strong></summary>
<br>
From traditional models to deep learning, I'm passionate about building and automating intelligent systems.
<ul>
  <li><strong>You Predict (Personal Project):</strong> Built an end-to-end time series forecasting system to predict YouTube video views with over 82% accuracy, using an XGBoost ensemble and BERT for feature engineering. The entire pipeline is automated on GCP.</li>
  <li><strong>UF Research (LemasLab):</strong> Fine-tuned a CNN with a self-attention mechanism in Keras, reducing loss by over 45% for predicting protein-peptide binding. I also automated the entire training workflow on a high-performance computing cluster (HiPerGator) using Docker, CUDA, and SLURM.</li>
  <li><strong>UF College of Medicine:</strong> Engineered an NLP pipeline using Llama 3.1 and Python to classify research publications, saving my team over 11 hours of manual work every week.</li>
</ul>
