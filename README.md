I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Florida passionate about full-stack development, system design, and ML/MLOps.

A lot of my work lives on private university and company repos, but this profile highlights my key projects and skills.

### What I Build

* [cite_start]**Full-Stack & Design:** I design and build full-stack applications, from data visualization tools with React and Node.js [cite: 24] [cite_start]to core product features using Next.js and TypeScript[cite: 30]. [cite_start]I enjoy optimizing performance, like reducing API latency by over 80% with Redis caching and SQL indexing[cite: 25].

* **Machine Learning & MLOps:** I engineer end-to-end ML systems. [cite_start]This includes everything from fine-tuning CNNs with Keras and PyTorch [cite: 18, 35] [cite_start]to deploying automated NLP pipelines with Python and GCP[cite: 26, 40]. [cite_start]I have experience automating training workflows on high-performance clusters using Docker, SLURM, and CUDA[cite: 19].

### My Tech Stack

* [cite_start]**Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL [cite: 43]
* [cite_start]**Frameworks:** React, Next.js, Node.js, Spring Boot, FastAPI, PyTorch, TensorFlow [cite: 44]
* [cite_start]**Tools & Platforms:** AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, CI/CD, SLURM [cite: 45]
* [cite_start]**Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis, Snowflake, Oracle SQL, MongoDB [cite: 46]

### âœ¨ Featured Project

#### [cite_start][You Predict](https://github.com/danielgeorge922) An end-to-end system to forecast YouTube video views with 82%+ accuracy using an XGBoost and BERT ensemble[cite: 39]. [cite_start]The project features a robust data pipeline on GCP [cite: 40] [cite_start]and a Next.js dashboard served from a FastAPI backend[cite: 41].
